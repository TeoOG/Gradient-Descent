# Gradient-Descent
Solving Ax=b, using the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm for a sparse pentadiagonal matrix
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentadiagonal_matrix

We're using the NumPy Python library for our matrices. Both of the Python files contain the same logic, we just feed different values, for every different matrix we work
on, as can be seen on the image below. We'are experimenting with different values of n, first for n=10, then for n=1000 and lastly for n=10000.
